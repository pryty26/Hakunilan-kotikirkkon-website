Hakunilan-kotikirkkon-website
(ok the project name is not good prr)
Custemer needs:
1.	A website that can show there all activities, and also can show who they are, and maybe can make youngs be intrest of them
2.	the admin can change all activities also add img's/video without programming.



Architecture:
plan-1:
Path: ‘/’ contains simple introduce and by click: read/learn more the user will arrive the sitemap(which contains all the path)
sitemap will contains for example /activities which will show all the information and activity plans, /who_we_are will show the all information of ‘Hakunilan kotikirkkon’,
/contact_us are planned show for example the church’s phonenumber,Email
And also /admin/login.
And the page about administractors back-end is already wrote.
Plan-2:
The ‘/’ contains automatically all sitemap by clicking button the user can arrive other paths
Plan-3
(I think this is the best plan but my front-end is so bad so its hard for me fortunately we have pro on the front-end)
The all paths top or beside contains sitemap which is simple to arrive other paths.
(bro I believe u)
Otherthings:
Of course we can add or change the content, so please say if u have any ideas
And the church has some weekly fixed activities:
Monday: clock:09:00-aamurukous
Thursday:clock13:00-ruokajakelu
Thursday:clock 18:00-rukous- ja yhteysilta
Sunday klo:12:00- seurakunta kokous, jossa myös musiikki lapsille pyhäkoulu
Problem
I know it heard so stupid but I don’t wanna do the add img's/video without programming.
Because I know u are on ctf/cybersecurity the file upload is so hard to protect/prevent maybe I can use the pillow but…I don’t like system that is unsafe
